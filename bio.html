	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I'm currently a Junior at Tufts University, and have been passionate about art and design since I was a kid. Since coming to Tufts, Engineering Psychology has allowed me to pursue design with a more human-centric focus in mind.</p>
	<p>Having grown up in both the US and Taiwan, I consider myself a third-culture kid and have had the opportunity to play with weaving the dual experience into my artwork. I'm a frequent flyer, which means I spend a lot of time doodling on planes.</p>
	<p>Outside of work and academics, I enjoy trying new restaurants and cafes, going to art museums, writing, and watching the latest movies.</p>
