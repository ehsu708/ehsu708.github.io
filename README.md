Aspects of the work that were implemented correctly were the html and css syntax. The content within the html fits the assignment requirements, and passes the HTML5 specifications. The css files pass the CSS specifications. The styling of the html was largely implemented to the degree that I wanted the webpage design to be.

An aspect of the assignment that could be improved is the CSS which could be cleaner by using more classes and ids.

I spent approximately 4 hours on the project.
